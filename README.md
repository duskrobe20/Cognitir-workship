# Cognitir-workship

On March 23, 2019 I had the opportunity to attend the Introduction to Product Management workshop from Cognitir.  They did a great job running us through some of what it is like to be a PM, especially in tech.  Neal Kumar lead the session and taught us how to use some of the common PM tools.  He also recommended we throw them up on GitHub as an exercise.
